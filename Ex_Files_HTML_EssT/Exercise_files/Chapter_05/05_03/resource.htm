    <p>Download our <a href="_assets/syntax.pdf" title="html syntax reference" download="HTML_syntax"> HTML syntax
        reference</a>! <!If you want to have the pdf open up in the browser you put .pdf instead of zip. You use the
        download attribute then it will download the file pdf (not zip files) when the user clicks it. By setting the
        download = to a name it automatically names the download that (in this case names HTML_syntax)instead of it being
        some long weird name.--> </p>
