    <p>  Here's a <b> paragraph </b>. </p>
    <pre>What
        <i> am </i> <em> I </em>?
        <b>I</b> am <strong> code </strong>!</pre>
    <!-- Pre formatting has the text show up on the page exactly as it is in the code (spaces, different line, etc. -->
    <!-- <i> and <em> usually do the same thing visually, except <em> has emphasis added to it when screen reader
    programs are parsing (reading line by line on the screen) the words out loud to the blind. <b> and <strong> likewise
    usually result in the same thing visually, but strong will be announced for the blind loudly. The b and i are for
    presentation. The reason they haven't been deprecated and replaced by strong and em is because sometimes you will
    want to italicized or bold something without it being emphasized differently in parsing (in speech)-->
    <h6> Size matters </h6>
    <!-- WIth cascading style sheets will be able to resize text without these cumbersome heading tags. Because you will
    change the size of various heading using CSS, you don't really want to use <h> to format the size of text. They're
    really more for denoting the importance of each part of the text/structuring the text. Just don't skip <h> numbers.

    <p> Make sure pages are properly formated and include p, paragraphs. Just don't make empty paragraphs to create
    space between them. You will use CSS for that. Technically you don't 'need' the closing paragraph tag, but they help
    to identify the structure of things when reading the code. </p>

    <!-- It would have been semantically incorrect to separate these elements (the address) that belong together with
    the p paragraph tag, thus I used the <br> line break tag. <b> don't need a closing tag </br>. In xml this wasn't the
    case and you used a self closing tag <br /> -->

        to create space for visual presentation, not this nbsp. </p>
    <!-- The non breaking space &nbsp; is for doing just that creating non-breaking space. When resizing a page this
    becomes particularly useful. It can make words or segments of words to not break when rezing a page. -->

    browser where to find this image. Width and height you want to display image at 100% of it's size. Alt gives a
    description of the image-->
    <p>Use align attribute to make the text wrap around the image,but really you should do this in CSS. </p>
