        <div class="reason"><!-- Div tag is used for separating content without wanting there to be any semantic (or
        special) meaning. Allows you to group up various elements. If there is a tag that passes on the semantic
        meaning of the content you should use that instead, but when you don't go ahead and use the Div tag. As you can
        see with this case, you can use the div tag to apply special CSS style to your code!-->
            <h4>You get to Build Things</h4>
            <p>Websites, blogs, dynamic apps, algorithims, AI solutions, and games among other software miracles are at
                literally at my finger tips with this kind of knowledge. With today's technology and constant new
                developments in the works there is all kinds of amazing things to do with coding!</p>
